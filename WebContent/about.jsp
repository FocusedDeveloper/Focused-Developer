			<p>I create software because I love it.  There is a deep feeling of satisfaction that comes from writing a piece of code that works.  Software development gives me a sense of both freedom and power; the freedom to create anything I can image, and the power to make it so.  Modern computers are truly powerful machines and I leverage that power by developing software.</p>

			<p>I got my first taste of programming with my scientific calculator back in high school.  I learned to program custom equations and became immediately hooked.  The increase in efficiency and accuracy were so impactful that my life was forever changed.  With this small handheld device, I drastically reduced the all too painful redundancy of math homework.  I would use my new skill in multiple courses, and it was not long before I was coding text-based games.</p>

			<p>I was fortunate enough to take my first computer science class in high school.  From that point on I would be a lifelong learner of the field.  I was formally taught C++ in college while earning my Associates in computer science.  I taught myself C# and Java from books and online resources, becoming officially certified in Java after passing Oracle's Java 8 exam.  All the while, my eyes were set on Android programming.  Thus, I partnered with Udacity and gained their Android Developer Nanodegree.</p>

			<p>Here we are today.  I picked up a few other technical skills along the way such as HTML, SQL, and Git version control.  My plan is to show use this site to continuously display and further my skillset.  My interest in computer science is forever growing, so I will continue my lifelong journey in education.</p>

			<p>Thank you for joining me!  Please enjoy your stay.</p>
